# Survival-of-a-population
This code is an implementation of a genetic algorithm. The problem I analyze is that of the survival of a certain number of individuals in an environment containing food, and venom
More details about the problem and the results can be found in the file **Report.pdf**

- **main.py**: contains the implementation of the genetic algorithm itself. For the graphical interface to run, it needs the pictures *mario*, *mario_mush* and *mario_banana*
- **main_tests.py**: unit tests of **main.py**
